If you want to contribute more, the next step after a newcomer issue is to solve a difficulty/low issue, which are usually 'real' issues which help the community. You can start looking around and see if you are interested/able to solve any of them. Also it's a good time to get familiar with coala and even its codebase.",no,,

In such a case there are many chances that you may not be too familiar with the languages that are needed. But it doesn't matter as it's never late to learn something new. If you have shown your callibre in one area, it means you can extend it to another. So concentrate on getting to know more about the org and proving your worth in areas that you are comfortable with so you may not end up getting rejected for the project that you will be aiming towards to any other candidate.

I am going to assume that the project idea you are talking about is yours (if you wanted to know about what you should do after selecting a project from the existing ideas ping me here again). So if its an idea that you have come up with then you should raise an issue [here](https://github.com/coala/projects/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Project+Proposal%22) and start discussing it with the maintainers and other developers, if it is considered as a potential improvement to coala you can start working on your gsoc proposal for that idea and get it reviewed by your potential mentors. @PrajwalM2212 ",no,,
@palash25  Thanks for the response. The project idea is from the existing ideas.,no,,

Just to clarify, we will not be getting anything like 50 slots because we have 50 mentors.  We are not a very large OSS organisation.  It doesnt matter how approachable we are, we will not get more slots because of that.  We got 10 slots last year, and any assumption we will get more this year is completely unfounded.

no.  upstream is a separate bullet,no,,

"Btw  @jayvdb should I mention it in my proposal that I have applied to Hyperledger, even though my first choice would be GSoC if I get selected for both (which is highly unlikely)?",no,,

And now @gaocegege is GSoC mentor with coala. ;),no,,
@ishanSrt yes!,no,,
@gaocegege was it a last minute proposal or did you take a few days to write it?,no,,
Maybe 3 days on the proposal. Actually I implemented a prototype in 2015 and the prototype helps me a lot.,no,,
which org was it?,no,,
"If you get a low or medium PR merged in coala repos, you've been through hell .. mentors in other orgs respect that :)",no,,
"@palash25 The Processing Foudation, the idea is also related to programming languages haha",no,,
Yeah my mentor in that org said he knows coala and he likes my contributions to coala,no,,
Is there some org like coala which uses `python` as a core or something but no js and other web language,no,,
"I don't have any experience in web :sweat_smile: , don't have any backup proposal  :sweat_smile:",no,,

Ok :+1: :,no,,
I was hoping if this could get merged https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2334. I would add it to my proposal. @jayvdb,no,,
"@MacBox7 
Consider adding a single link to a github search that lists all your PRs :sweat_smile: 
It will be dynamic then : )",no,,
Yup,no,,
But it is good to hightlight your best work,no,,
"@MacBox7 , im not the best reviewer for that one. I dont fully understand the motivation/intentions for the changes rrquested",no,,

3 more drafts in. Keep them coming,no,,
"Just put 'in progress' for sections you havent finished yet, and submit, so mentors can see it in the system and check thwm",no,,
Hey @jayvdb I have sent a draft for the [Next Generation Action System project](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=next_generation_action_system&lang=en) and I realised that implementing that proposal would also work for the [Improve Diff Handling project](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=improve_diff_handling&lang=en). I mean completing the Nextgen Action System project would complete a huge portion of the Improve Diff Handling project. So a proposal on similar lines would work for both the projects. Do you think I should submit a different proposal for the Improve Diff Handling project as well?,no,,
No need. Your title and abstract are ok,no,,
Yeah I had mentioned both of them in the abstract. Would it help if I mention both those projects in the title as well?,no,,
No,no,,
Keep the title simple,no,,
Dont stress.,no,,
"If you are getting stressed, go write an application for another org",no,,
Okay sure :-),no,,
@jayvdb Sent my draft.,no,,
I will update the PR.,no,,
"ok, well it is still not a student task ... that will be done by us",no,,
emmm It also works for me to keep LS in coala-vs-code if we just support visual studio code in this GSoC idea.,no,,
I expect perfecting vs-code will be enough heartache for 3 months,no,,
"OK, then I got it.",no,,
:smile:,no,,
"anyway, we decide later.  strategy could vary depending on the proposal and the applicant",no,,
"Yeah, then I think we could write a general project proposal but it seems that you think the PR is too general.",no,,
often a student writes a proposal which is slightly different to the idea,no,,
@jayvdb Could you please have a look at my proposal. I have just added implementation detail for one bear. I have doubts regarding others so left comments on the issues. https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/557#issuecomment-375220512 and https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/1431#issuecomment-375230884 .

Good news is that many students who prepared with coala last year did get slots with other orgs. Good PRs are good. All mentors can see good code.,no,,

welcome to the developer team @li-boxuan,no,,
and @MacBox7,no,,
Thank you! Happy to get admitted. May I also ask if you can assign me to this issue https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2352,no,,
and @virresh,no,,
"@jayvdb 
Added travis [here](https://travis-ci.org/virresh/ChatIT)",no,,
Thanks :smile:,no,,
@virresh I guess you didn't include coala-bears in your requirements.txt,no,,
"@MacBox7, can you add your circle2.0 config to our user docs",no,,
"Ah, yep 
Thanks @li-boxuan ",no,,
it should go in dev-requirements.txt or test-requiremnts.txt,no,,
or some other non-formalised name like that,no,,
"and then in `.travis.yml` , `before_install: cat *-requirements.txt > requirements.txt`",no,,
"Ah, thanks for pointing that out. That's much cleaner.",no,,
"@kriti21 , the most important part of that comment was you should be using ClangBear .  We already have three bears which use ClangBear, and one of them is quite similar to what your bear proposal will involve.",no,,
"ClangBear has an ast, and it supports a lot of languages.",no,,
"and if you are considering doing your own gsoc idea, you need to submit it to coala/projects repo",no,,
"Thanks @li-boxuan  and @jayvdb 
This little excercise made me realise my flask dependencies locally are getting out of date 
Just got them updated :smile: 
And now travis also seems happily [running ](https://travis-ci.org/virresh/ChatIT/builds/356670011)",no,,
@jayvdb okay sure.,no,,
Thanks @jayvdb Will do that.,no,,
@jayvdb Could we  discuss about the idea coala Language Server? I think we have different understanding on the idea.,no,,
"In my view, I think the students should implement a language server in the repo `coala/language-server` and `coala/coala-vs-code` is just an user of the language server.",no,,
Although the code in the vs code plugin could be reused in the language server.,no,,
And the student's work is to implement such a language server and a basic plugin frontend to demonstrate the language works well.,no,,
WDYT,no,,
"Maybe there is not enough time for so much work if the student starts from scratch, but we already have a basic language server and plugin frontend in coala-vs-code. Then I think it is at a medium level of difficulty.",no,,
"if we require they start a new repo, they will copy `coala/coala-vs-code` to `coala/language-server` and work from there",no,,
"I do see the value of the first phase being to create a stub/proxy LS , as a very useful standalone project which could be copied to create the new coala LS",no,,
"but perhaps that should be a suggestion , rather than a hard requirement.  there are also two other python LS implementations which could be forked and modified to create the coala LS.",no,,
so the student has options,no,,
emmm Will the language server be in coala-vs-code or the new repo in this GSoC idea?,no,,
I think the language server is a dependent component and it should not be in coala-vs-code.,no,,
why does it matter now ?,no,,
https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/495#discussion_r175981203,no,,
If we need to support multiple clients I think it matters :thinking:,no,,
our language server should be client-neutral ; support any client .. ?,no,,
"I think so, or why should we implement such a language server.",no,,
so there should be no need for any client plugins,no,,
"the clients build their own plugins, and they should all work with coala LS",no,,
"Yeah then I  think we should have a new repo for the LS, not in coala-vs-code.",no,,
"coala-vs-code should only contain the plugin code, not LS, IMO",no,,
but it will contain a lot of the same code as coala-vs-code,no,,
there will be no plugin code ... ?,no,,
"when the LS is complete, no vs-code plugin is needed",no,,
that part will eventually be discarded from the repo when it is no longer needed,no,,
"a possible compromise is that the coalaLS repo is a clone of coala-vs-code , and we lock coala-vs-code until after the project is completed.  then we can decide whether we need two repos or not",no,,
https://github.com/coala/coala-vs-code/tree/master/vscode-client will be kept since it is the front-end for coala LS. and the code about LS in coala-vs-code could be removed.,no,,
I am not sure if I understand you. Do you mean that we should keep the LS in vs-code repo during the GSoC?,no,,
we create a new `coala/coalaLS` repo as a clone of `coala/coala-vs-code` ?,no,,
(if a proposal is approved),no,,
"OK,  it works for me.",no,,
Recently I contacted @traff regarding coala Intellij project but I didn't get a response. I want to know the mentor for this project @Makman2 @jayvdb,no,,

"@kriti21, I don't think @abhsag24 will be the mentor this year as I talked with him on other social media and he told me that this year he may not work as mentor. So my suggestion is don't wait for him or if you want you can check him on fb. ",no,,

@rohanrk  yes it matches,no,,
@Mohit17067 it would be best that rather than asking something about say installing a bear and how to resolve it's dependencies. You try doing it. You come up with a script. For eg if you think conda will work then write down why it will work. What are the cons of using it. What are the problems you see with it? Then from a basic proposal I can help you build a better more detailed one,no,,
@virresh you would benefit from having good knowledge about the core.,no,,
@Naveenaidu I don' think we need to change current options. The multiple patches should be a drill down. If I select ApplyPatchAction then if there are multiple patches available from a bear we should let them pick,no,,
The Bears don't need a new settings variable. The bear writer can already define settings that isn't a setting which is needed.,no,,
Or implementation which is needed,no,,
I think you should think more about handling this thing in non interactive mode,no,,
Probably default settings for non interactive mode is the way to go,no,,
Also you should think about the Diff class itself. How would the class look if say it had to apply a CamelCase patch to all bears. What all information should it have,no,,
Can you come up with some more ideas of where a bear with multiple patches would be applicable?,no,,
"@Udayan12167 I think we should let the user choose if he wants to apply the default patches or apply all possible patches by handling it just like git does in conflict handling in non interactive mode. As @jayvdb said we are going to extend multiple patches to multiple bears as well. So it will suggest multiple patches from different bears, instead of just one. Implementing that will be a bit tricky in current `diff`. Because we use original unchanged lines as reference in current diff class aka `original file coordinate system` ( as @Makman2 likes to call it :wink: ). But when we implement `modified-file coordinate system` then producing multiple patches will become a bit easier. I propose we increase the scope of project to implement multiple patches from multiple bears instead of just creating just one bear which applies multiple patches. What are your opinions? Also are there any more mentors who would like to discuss this project? I have seen many issues related to this project by @Makman2 ",no,,

We are trying to build a user friendly tool so that there is no further need for installing all bears if user needs only one and if we add such a big package as its dependency then I think it will loose its main benefit.

"@Udayan12167 Alright, so all we want to do is give the flexibility of selecting a patch from multiple patches provided by a bear and store it too, and provide the user the option to apply a patch which uses his input as the correction, for example a badly named bear, can achieved by creating another diff and using placeholders. This will make patches more ""interactive"". This is what I have inferred till now correct me if I am wrong. Now, how the storing patches thing will work and how will we know that if user wants to just apply this patch here or wants to store it? Should it be on a case by case basis, i.e. store all the patches which involve syntax, I mean like the parenthesis example you gave, and don't store grammatical corrections etc. Is this what `templating mechanism`in project description is referring to?",no,,

" Hello Mentors, I am interested in the project [improve diff handling] (https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=improve_diff_handling&lang=en)
for GSOC. I have the following ideas on how to approach this project. It would be really nice if you could look into them and please give a your views.And I am really Sorry for taking up your time.

**A) Make a Bear to pass multiple diffs**:-

There are two ways in my opinion in which we can achieve this:-

1) IMHO The only feasible option that i can think of is to Allow Bears to pass their own custom actions to coala. For example let us assume that we have a bear named `VariableNameBear` that corrects or checks if the variables are named,
correctly i.e either in `CamelCase` or `under_score case` the output of the bear should be like:-

         test.py
    [   3] minion-party = x
    **** SomeBear [Section: cli | Severity: NORMAL] ****
    !    ! Wrong variable name convention:
    [    ] *0. Do (N)othing
    [    ]  1. (O)pen file
    [    ]  2. Show Patch 1
    [    ]  3. Show Patch 2
    [    ]  4. Apply Patch 1
    [    ]  5. Apply Patch 2
    [    ]  6. Add a manual Patch
    [    ]  7. Add (I)gnore comment
    [    ]  8. Make this a default patch for this issue
    [    ] Enter number (Ctrl-D to exit): 
2) Or directly force the use for an input to correct the particular issue. This will take the user directly the option which asks for user to input his correction.

         test.py
    [   3] minion-party = x
    **** SomeBear [Section: cli | Severity: NORMAL] ****
    !    ! Wrong variable name convention:
    [    ] Please Enter your correction: 
IMO I think the first option would be a feasible one. The reason for me to suggest that we need to allow custom actions to be passed by a bear because, there might be cases where we **need a sequence of actions to pop up for a patch to be fixed**. And also because the actions provided by coala as of now are all predefined in `processing.py` and in `ConsoleInteraction.py` no way will they help if we need to pass multiple patches, since they obviously need to be coming from the bear makers.
But, If we pass the design of actions to the bear makers, wont they have to think a lot on how to make the actions and stuff. The main aim of coala was **not** to burden the bear makers with the implementation design. One solution to it would be that
we make a seperate Class called as `custom action` into the` coala core` and bear makers can access this class just by `custom_action.add(""Some Action"")"" `. And our custom action will take care of the rest. And when ever this class is invoked
we can just pass these action instead of the default actions to the coala.

 **B) We also need to add a settings parameter.** As suggested by @Udayan12167 I mean to say that what if a patch generated by VariableNameBear needs to be applied entirely to the project. We wouldn't want the user to always be correcting the naming convention of the file again and again in a large code base. That's why as shown above i think it's better to give the user the option to Make a patch as a default. What this will do is it will take the patch the user needs to apply and update the setting in the section.

The user can use the `chain action functionality` of coala and enter `48` as the input and the `patch 2`  gets applied and along with it the setting in the section will also be updated to recognize these kind of issues and auto apply the patch.
Please Correct me if i am wrong, coala takes up a section and executes the setting in the section at the very first run of coala and i guess it is not possible to update the setting in the section on the fly. So when the user choose `Make Patch as default Action` the coala has to exit out and update the setting. So the next run the coala will remmeber the setting and apply it.
These are the things i have thought as of soon. Please let me know your opinions.

And **another question **is, How are we going to show multiple patches in non interactive mode . And is it actually neccesssary to have multiple diffs in non interactive mode.
",no,,
@Naveenaidu wrong link to the project :wink:,no,,
"Thanks :smile: 
",no,,
"in non-interactive mode, there is configuration for what actions should be taken.  if the configuration doesnt provide a do-able action, then it is an error.",no,,
"IMO improved diff handling is supposed to avoid any custom-ness being pushed onto the bear writer.  The bear writer would create a `Result` object that has multiple patches in it, and probably some metadata describing why they are different alternatives.  it is then coala core's responsibility to offer multiple options to the user.",no,,
"automating re-application of the same patch is a different problem, as it also applies to existing `Result` which have only a single diff.  this is quite feasible to start working on now, and isnt very difficult.  A little bit of intelligence needs to be added to correctly allow the same patch to be applied whenever the same problem is found throughout the codebase",no,,
"@jayvdb  Then allowing `custom action` is a bad option right? So we need to design the solution in such a way that the bear writer can easily send patches through the result object and not worry about anything?

",no,,
"yup.  there are times for custom actions, but 'multiple patches' needs to be a core feature",no,,
"Should this be a part of `Improve diff handling` or is it completely different

"eventually, we might have different linters providing the different patches for the same line of code",no,,
"That becomes a problem then, wont coala raise a `ConflictError` in such cases?
",no,,
"automating re-using  patches already selected is a way to make the improve diff handling project bigger, if necessary, in order to fill three months",no,,
"providing a better UI for multiple patches to the same line is part of what that project is about.  so no, it shouldnt raise a `ConflictError` - it should let the user decide which patches to select",no,,
"@jayvdb I propose we introduce Diff handling methods  and let the bear author call the method which passes control to the used so that we can take his input. The method will contain various parameters will allow the author to pass message string and various conditions based of the situation.

@nvzard wouldn't integrating bears in different languages be a nightmare?,no,,
Not integrating it,no,,
a cli tool based on question and answers,no,,
Sorry for the silly question. But  Are there  any top priority projects  which coala is aiming for?,no,,
"@Udayan12167 @Adrianzatreanu @fneu I am interested in http://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=improve_installation_of_coala_and_coala-bears&lang=en 
I did some tests on coala/cib but it seems to be all broken. After few attempts, I ended up on an import error 
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'call_without_output'
```
and got to know about few closed issues related to that https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3940 .
I also looked at https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/845 , but don't know that solving this issue will help or not as cib is not working properly. If yes, then I would like to work on that issue since there is no update from a long time. Also what else can I look for this project?",no,,
"@palash25 cPickle was one of @Siddhartha1234's proposed improvements too (he applied to work on the project too). IIRC replacing picke with cPickle will be better, unless they changed pickle internals. So yeah, that could be one of the proposed improvements (but we're looking for more sophisticated improvements; once again, you should talk to @Siddhartha1234 as he had a whole host of improvements proposed).",no,,
@adtac I didn't know that it was already proposed. Fine I'll try to get in touch with him.,no,,
"BTW, I should mention: I most probably won't be mentoring that (or any) project this summer officially. So you'll probably need to find a primary mentor for the project. I can help out unofficially however.",no,,
@palash25 it was a part of his proposal from last year. No idea if he is applying again this year.,no,,
@adtac The other mentor mentioned for the project is @sils should I contact him? Or maybe @Makman2 since he is working on the NextGen Core which is also performance related.,no,,
"sils -  don't know, but he might not have the time. Makman - he probably won't have the time as he's busy these days.",no,,
">should I contact him?

I think you just did :P",no,,
Yeah right,no,,
"anyway, only they can answer the question best",no,,
Hey does anybody know if http://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=one_click_linting_for_online_projects_in_the_browser&lang=en will come under coala or open roberta labs?,no,,
"No sorry, however one guy from Open Roberta recently said he has no time for some kind of cooperation or so, so I would tend to say this project won't/can't really happen from coala's side^^ But not finally sure^^",no,,
"@adhikasp @userzimmermann I was thinking if it's possible to have a GSoC project for this year making coala-quickstart ""aspects-compatible"" (right now it just ask some questions and uses some insights from project content to generate the old style `.coafile`). I haven't followed up the project since a long time, and now its too much to catch up :sweat_smile: , so wanted to know your views :)",no,,
Is any maintainer willing to mentor [Optimize Caching](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=optimize_caching&lang=en) project for GSoC?,no,,
@Makman2 that sucks it seemed like a very cool project. I guess I will work on some other project then :sweat_smile:,no,,
@Mohit17067 working on CIB issue should provide a good start on that project. I think one important thing you need to focus on with cib is dependency resolution for each bear.,no,,
@Udayan12167 You mean https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/845 right?,no,,
"@Udayan12167 For dependency resolution, Should I go through the working of cib properly or think of my own new ideas?",no,,
Is anyone working actively on Improving lint bear quality as a gsoc idea? :),no,,
@jayvdb @sils I would like to work on http://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=improve_diff_handling&lang=en should I start working on a cEP right now or make some other contribution before starting on it? I really like this idea and would love to work on it. I have understood that we are aiming to produce multiple patches for the same issue but how exactly are we going to achieve this is still a bit unclear to me :sweat_smile: It would be a great help if you could shine some light on it. :smile:,no,,
"> Is any maintainer willing to mentor [Optimize Caching](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=optimize_caching&lang=en) project for GSoC?
",no,,
https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=real-time_team_communication_bridge&lang=en,no,,
I would like to be a mentor for this project,no,,
@virenparmar I don't think you can apply to be a mentor for a project since you are not an experienced coala developer,no,,
Is it mandatory for a patch to be accepted in order to write a proposal?,no,,
@Naveenaidu yes you need to fulfill the minimum requirements and become a coala dev as far as I know,no,,
@Vedarth I think you should contribute more and after if you are accepted you will have time to work on cEP. Talk with us about what ideas you have for the project :wink:,no,,
@Nosferatul Any particular area where I should focus on?,no,,
Given the fact I am interested in this project :smile:,no,,
"i think the core of coala. Also you should check out https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/1021, it's   a related issue in the project description.  Also maybe https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3123",no,,
they have ideas for your project,no,,
Wait we have to submit CEP before before applying for the project na?,no,,
"@RaiVaibhav, cEP is always written with a lower case c.",no,,
:sweat_smile:,no,,
I think same detail like cEP will be in GSOC proposal,no,,
@Nosferatul  `The applicant has made a cEP of how the profiling will be implemented has been merged.` means application must submit their cEP before applying for that project and also it have to be get approved by mentors?,no,,
I have the same doubt whether we have to submit the GSOC proposal first or the cEP,no,,
Proposal first and if you get selected then you have to work on the cEP,no,,
@nvzard :+1:,no,,
@Nosferatul Thanks for your suggestion. I will start working on it :smile:,no,,
Hello mentors! I'm interested in `Newcomer metrics and gamification` project. :smile:,yes,,
"Hello mentors, I am interested in  the project diff handling. I had a doubt. Since @Vedarth is already working on the project can i work on the project too?",yes,,
@Naveenaidu  any number of people can work on the same project. In the end the best proposal will be selected,no,,
you can write more proposals for more projects (i think 3 is max),no,,
"@adtac @Makman2 regarding the optimize caching project, does it involve improving caching only for the current core or does it also involve implementing/integrating caching for the nextgen core?",no,,
"when the project was originally proposed, nextgen wasn't in the source tree",no,,
"but now that it is, you can propose your own set of performance improvements",no,,
(imo),no,,
