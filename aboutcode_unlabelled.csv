In older wheel versions we had that file created. That's mostly legacy at this stage as this has been dropped since. We still need to process a whole PyPI archive eventually, so that's why we keep this. BUT this is questionable at best and this SHOULD BE documented and is not

We have a test file here https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/tests/packagedcode/data/pypi/metadata.json

And this was dropped, like 3 eons ago in wheel proper:

Right now dowsing requires a directory and I'm wondering how to best adapt that.

`parse(location)` only receives a single path and being able to resolve (and merge) data from multiple manifests be it for installed or ""develop"" is not there. 
There are a few things to consider:
1. `packagedcode` for now scans one file at a time and collects manifests. It kinda lies by saying a single manifest equals a package,   and pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, setup.py  is a great example to which you could add a (pinned or not) requirements file (but same with Gemfile, *.spec and Gemfile.lock or package.json, package-lock.json, node-shrinkwrap.json and yarn.lock and so on)
2. there are possibly two ways to go at this: 
2.1 one is to allow a parser to wander around from a location and move around to collect and merge data from other files (but there are issues to resolve as the other files would be scanned on their own, so this would require maintaining quite a bit state across files at scan time something we do not do at all for now)
2.2 the other would be to collect all the file-level data as we do today and assemble/merge them in a post processing stage (either in scancode-toolkit proper with a postscan plugin or in scancode.io as a pipeline step leverage the database storage in that later case)

So net-net: this is a conceptually simple problem but the solution is not entirely trivial (at least on our side because of the volume and variety of packages we can encounter) ",no

"> 2.1 one is to allow a parser to wander around from a location and move around to collect and merge data from other files

In the context of how could dowsing be integrated, it's pretty easy to drop in as it gives you back a Distribution and you don't care about the non-metadata fields.  It _needs_ to look around and being asked to interpret setup.cfg if the build-backend is poetry is nonsensical, but it doesn't know that without also reading pyproject.toml",no
"so I could modify dowsing to give you single-file knowledge, and merging those isn't that terrible... but it does mean ignoring data would be up to you, if I'm not allowed to look around.

"@thatch I do not have a concern with ""meandering"" around on other files in earnest, this is more a matter of reporting the raw data in these cases so we can attribute them to a one or more given files.

"@thatch which really makes me think that the current approach to scanning one file at a time is flawed. Traceability of data as comming from a file is nice, but not the most important things. So I think we should completely rework the package manifest handling such that 
1. a package is a bunch of metadata and a bunch of files. (and a package != its package manifest) which really means we should report a package as its own entity and not dangling as a manifest file child.
2. package metadata collectors should be left to meander as they please across multiple files. And the contract should be that they must report the list of files they have used (just which ones and not how in details they were used).",no

2. for Go, we can handle go.mod and go.sum at once, as well as some possible holdovers related manifests

and script will pip download and create sdist for that if we follow earlier idea of making sdist,no
is there CI for this project?,no
"Yes, we have ` azure-pipelines, travis,appveyor ` for scancode-toolkit repo",no
"Yes, ci will also do",no
"so why wouldn't building this thing (pyinstaller, not-sdist/wheelhouse, etc) not just be done in that instead of via romp?",no
"@altendky re:

>  i thought collecting the wheels for the platforms was required for building the not-sdist (aka, wheelhouse).

it is exactly that :)",no
I cannot really trust azure for manylinux-type builds btw. Their setup is not really standard,no
mm?  you do manylinux builds in the manylinux docker images.  so you mostly don't care where they run.  or does azure somehow break those images?,no
"i used cibuildwheel to handle wheel building when binaries are involved.  well, for twisted anyways.",no
"no :) you have to use an image there, I meant that the default linux image are not really standard",no
i mean i use docker for python in gha (which is backed by azure more or less),no
i think that https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-twisted/blob/37693ec18f41216e8255e761b9dbfdd149fbc705/.github/workflows/ci.yml is more or less my preferred ci setup.  though it matrixes across a couple more dimensions than most people need so a lot of stuff would be deleted for other projects.,no
neato,no
@pombredanne : you means to say that After uploading all wheels you can merge. Or give me token i can upload,no
@altendky does the github thing has the same syntax as Azure? ,no
@Abhishek-Dev09 either way :),no
@pombredanne : Which way you want :),no
@pombredanne nope.  related iirc.  been awhile since i really worked on azure stuff,no
but GHA is definitely my favorite CI to work with.  best os coverage for python plus python versions plus matrixing features plus concurrent jobs,no
@Abhishek-Dev09 either way. I can give you access to the final repo and you can create your token there,no

"> it is not a substitute for the requirements file and the pypi-as-a-github-release but can be a replacement for the relase tarballd

"so if you want to use it and can pull it off, that’s great",no
your call,no
:),no
"main adnantage is that it also include python user will not need to install python , we create both sdist and pyinstaller ",no
:+1: ,no
it is nice to provide a wheel (or more if the project isn't pure python).  sdist still involves arbitrary code execution for installation and getting metadata and wheels don't.  so good distribution in the python ecosystem is both sdist and wheel and pyinstaller covers non-python ecosystem.  flatpak etc and linux distro packages being another set of things to consider.  i guess some might pick flatpak and whatever else like that before pyinstaller.  i haven't worked with those much,no
@altendky : What is faltpak?,no

@pombredanne : Review my PR also . if possible merge it,no
I am still reviewing ... I will likely also need to split in two with the wheel removal in a separate PR ,no
because of this https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/2161#issuecomment-677897735,no
@pombredanne : Do you have any query related to PR?,no
@Abhishek-Dev09 pinged me in #2072 but...  what's the goal?  why not shiv or a devpi that keeps all the packages you need stuff from?,no
and there's my gitter inexperience linking to the wrong repo there...,no
@altendky : i have no exp of using shiv or a devpi . But i already told you yesterday about creation of sdist of different os/python.,no
and i said that is not what an sdist is,no
"@altendky : Yes , that you said but another idea you have that can install scancode offline",no
shiv takes your program and dependencies and packages it up into a zipapp (more or less at least) so the only external dependency is the python for which it was built.  pyinstaller does that + includes python.  devpi would be a mirror of pypi you make so you can have more control.,no
"so the question is, what is the goal?",no
"to avoid dependencies getting removed from pypi and no longer available for installation?  to turn a python program into a program?  if it's really just 'collect artifacts together' then you `pip download` (or maybe `pip wheel`, i'd have to check the effective differences).  but the result is certainly not an sdist",no
rather a wheelhouse,no
what is the need for offline installs?,no
We want to create an archive that give user all tools needed for os/python so that user will easily install offline . So that he did not download irrelevant wheels which is not needed. ,no
i will look at shiv,no
people normally don't download irrelevant wheels,no
you have to go out of your way to explicitly do that,no
"> what is the need for offline installs?

being able to install offline. On isolated machines, with no access to anything. This is an app, not a library",no
but why is this offline install need so great for scancode?,no
@pombredanne : have u any idea about shiv?,no
and it sounds less like 'offline install' and more like 'turn this python program into a program',no
which is generally pyinstaller,no
just because it happens this is a common need. Several users have their code in places that cannot access the internet for security reasonss That's the way it is,no
"or linux system packages sometimes  (dev, rpm, etc)",no
and they can't `pip download`?  it seems like they would already be quite prepared to deal with this,no
"if they could, I would not try to solve a non issue",no
"so they aren't python devs.  so they want a program, not python code and a pile of packages.  right?",no
it is also a matter of UX. These users are NOT developers and when they may be they may not be Python developers,no
"ok, so it's about the 'a program' thing.  pyinstaller is the common answer for that.",no
they don't even have to provide the python,no
"(though to avoid confusion, pyinstaller doesn't make an installer.  it makes a file or pile of files that you would feed to an installer.  names are bad :[ )",no
(or a single file that you wouldn't use with an installer),no
"> so they aren't python devs. so they want a program, not python code and a pile of packages. right?

yes, and I appreciate that this could be done with pyinstaller, debs, rpms and NSIS. All that is in the future. For now, as a go between we need to collect the set of dependent wheels for each os/arch/python combos (and we get that from our own devpi alright) so that a tarball can be created. The sdist is s red herring... this is just a convenient shortcut to create a tarball",no
why can't you just pyinstaller?,no
"we could for sure, but that does not remove the need of getting all the proper wheels for each of the 12 installable combos we need to have: win32/win64/mac/linux64 x py36/37/38 (and soon 39) 
and that will come later",no
if you just install your thing in such a way you get the versions you want then you pyinstaller it.,no
and covering the different versions is just a matrix setup in a github actions (or whatever) CI system that you should already have for running tests,no
"though i didn't follow what part is coming later.  i thought collecting the wheels for the platforms was required for building the not-sdist (aka, wheelhouse).  and that it really actually isn't required to get the wheels collected for doing pyinstaller",no
@pombredanne : https://pypi.org/project/shiv/ tool for creating is self-contained Python zipapps  including deps,no
still requires the user to provide a compatible python,no
"also, romp is kinda a shortcut for when you want to do something without making a CI setup for it.  building release artifacts seems like a not-romp activity.",no
i use it for 1) building my multiple lock files that cover multiple platforms and 2) occasionally to build wheels for projects that won't do it themselves.,no
`romp --platform linux --interpreter cpython --version 3.6 --version 3.7 --version 3.8 --platform windows --platform macos --architecture x86_64 --command 'python script.py' --artifact-paths '*.whl' --artifact 'artifacts.tar.gz' --build-request-url 'https://dev.azure.com/Abhiromp/romp/_apis/build/builds?api-version=5.0' --definition-id 6 --username Abhiromp --archive-path '.' --verbose`,no

So is there a possibility of migrating to a python based GUI app altogether say maybe like Qt5 or something? ",no
3 stars more for hitting 1k :) so close,no
"@aa-deet-eeya_gitlab Yes, it seems like it would be very hard to make some sort of mashed up python+electron application. 

Two solutions:
1) The python GUI/QT5 application 
    * This may be a possibility. However, we lack significant QT5/GUI application development experience (the reason why we were choosing electron in the first place). If someone came along with the proper experience, this may be an option.

2) Migrate the entire application to a web-based Django application.
    * This way, we can re-use some of the front-end libraries/views while mirgrating the data side to Django ORM + functions. This would change the nature of the application, as it would no longer be distributed via an OS-specific application binary. 

At this point, #2 would probably make more sense for us. It would also require the most changes and probably be a re-write of the backend/DB portion.

@aa-deet-eeya_gitlab thoughts?",no
"Yes,  the #1 point doesn't make much sense. You'll surely need someone with a considerable amount of exp in that GUI field also python GUIs are not the best to work with, at least that's the general consensus on the internet. 
About #2, Views and Libraries can be certainly be reused. But not so sure about the Back end, Do you plan to send the files to be scanned across to the server from the Client-side? What about the considerably larger codebase and scanning the files? Or will it take directly from somewhere in the cloud?
Client-side pre-processing can be done using WASM though, that's one possibility. However, it would bring a whole new set of problems to tackle.
Otherwise, scanning it directly from Cloud is another possibility.
Manually uploading from say the Client-side seems kind of meh for bigger files, but that's just my opinion.
In the meantime let me research more on this #2 idea",no
@majurg ,no
"Interesting, I see there's already a REST API: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-server",no
"@aa-deet-eeya_gitlab All good points here. I think the end goal would be a web interface that resembles the current workbench's functionality. We have prototyped various scancode server applications and have been thinking about a frontend

There is a balance though, as you mentioned it may not be the most practical way to handle large scan files like a desktop app would. ",no
"What framework do you have in mind for the frontend? @majurg 
React looks like a good option to me, but that's just me.",no
"No preference, but we will need something that can support very large tables and table sizes. Currently, we use jquery DataTables, bu there may be more modern (and better) alternatives. ",no
"Yes, jQuery doesn't seem to be the best way to implement tables or UI. 
But if you decide on a React based frontend, then do let me know
I'd be really happy to help :)",no
@aa-deet-eeya_gitlab Do you think React can handle tabular data well?,no
"I have not played around with it, but if it does, it might be worth a simple mockup",no
"Well, React can handle tabular data, but it really depends on the size of the data set and how you wish to visualize it. And depending on that you would proceed to further optimize your interface, if required. A logical step towards this would be identifying your needs and deciding on the library (or in rare cases making an in-house library for your tailored needs, but chances are you'll find a robust library online).
I personally haven't dealt with larger data sets, but simply searching around suggested that you would certainly require optimizations, which can be tricky at times depending on the use case. But then, I'm not so sure about this point, certain libraries might handle this just fine.
Other than that, React is fun the UI/UX shouldn't be an issue. 
",no
"Also React isn't the only option out there, there might be something better for certain needs.
But for an interface similar to Scancode workbench, React will do just fine.  @majurg ",no
@aa-deet-eeya_gitlab awesome It seems like react is pretty popular these days as well. Do you have experience here? I would love to look at some resources / tutorials out there if you know any just to get an idea of what’s involved ,no
"No experience with React, I kinda started with the backend lol. 
I started learning React only recently, mostly go to youtube and watch some tutorials. There's one by freecodecamp which serves as a very great introduction to React. ",no
"Apart from that, the official docs are also amazing.",no
"I looked around this issue last night https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/issues/457

Executing (default): SELECT TRIM(`copyright_holders`), `copyright_holders` FROM `flat_files` AS `flat_files` WHERE `flat_files`.`path` LIKE 'workbench-issue-457/xml%' AND `flat_files`.`type` != 'directory';
```
So the pattern matching is done instead of looking for the absolute path(?)
so ""workbench-issue-457/xml%"" is also true for path ""workbench-issue-457/xmlpatterns""

This query can be viewed in the dev console of electron window by including

Hi :sunny: ,no
"Hey @Totoola-Kehinde, great we could do it together. 
For now, I think there are 2 ways to go about this particular project. 
1. Take and improve the existing workbench, which probably needs refactoring of the Schemas involved and improve things here and there. I'm currently looking into certain issues with the workbench. Particularly for an improved querying method. But my rusty knowledge of SQL databases isn't helping much.
2. Make another workbench sort of client (?) which would require a web-based solution to this. For that, we could make a new prototype or pick up the existing RESTful API prototype and improve on it.

"# Scancode Installation

Scancode usees Python3.6 so I suggest you to create a virtual environment of python3.6 and then use `pip3 install scancode` command to install  scancode.

When you link your packagedcode with the scancode software, try to execute the project to know your results.

I use commands to install scancode:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit
$ cd scancode-toolkit
$ pip3 install .
$ pip3 install -e .
```
`pip3 install .` will install the software software.
and
from `pip3 install -e .`you don't need to run `pip3 install .` again and again, otherwise you have to run `pip3 install .` everytime whenever you make changes. 

you can run scancode software by:
`scancode <filepath> -p --json-pp <outputfile_name>.json`
Eg: `scancode Pipfile.lock -p --json-pp output.expected.json`

If you have any other way to install and run the software you can use that too:)",no

"> @pombredanne @aj4ayushjain @majurg The project ""Build scancode installer for supported os'es"" - to create scancode installer for 'linux via SNAP package'. Since snap is a package format similar to rpm or deb created for snappy package manager. There is a tool called snapcraft (https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-format). it is an automation tool for developers to package their applications as snaps. So basically the end user will be using snappy as package manager to pull and install application and developers will be using snapcraft to actually turn their application into a snap. This is the idea which i have to go ahead to build snapcode-toolkit package.

This is to be refined... one good way to think about this is how the ""purpose"" classification would be used and matter.

For instance documentation is a clear one: the documentation origin and license may be different from the rest of the code of a package or software project and that's OK. The documentation ""purpose"" is well understood and different from   say code used for testing or building the software",no
"broadly I'd say doc, tests, core code, dead code, prototype, build scripts, etc. this will have to be discussed as we go... and you will get frequent feedback from mentors and the community for that. See also the clearlydefined ""facets"" idea for a related concept https://github.com/clearlydefined/clearlydefined/blob/master/docs/clearly.md#facets",no
@MankaranSingh BUT purpose is not facets. The purpose is actually more generic than CD facets ,no
I hope this is clear enough,no
At a high level the goal is have have files that are analyzed put in different classes and focus the license + origin analysis and summarization in each of these buckets separately ,no
@not4win ^,no
@not4win and decision trees can indeed be useful as they provide understandable ML and have little to no overhead at run time,no

We are fully open to ML! I doubt that you can beat the current diff-based approach with ML for license detection though, both in precision, recall, speed,  correctness with similar requirements of disk space and memory. There have been several projects that made attempts in that area and none has succeeded. I you want to take a crack at this please go for it... BUT we warned that this is unlikely the best way to think about the license detection problem. Instead, the copyright detection is a much more constrained problem domain and it may be possible to get some interesting results there.

An area that may be suited for ML and AI would be a new ability to detect anomalies in scans IMHO

you have a good point but there are a few reasons:
1. it is always good not to have all your eggs in the same basket (unless you want to make a giant omelette of cours)
2. more seriously, the diversity we have there is useful: ats cale there are subtle differences in every linux, mac and windows installations and running the tests on various OS versions and config has proven to be important.
For instance, the Linux and Python configs on Azure are ... humm.. how to say this ... not really common and mainline. Weird at the best.
So keeping the diverstoty there is useful. 

Since Azure is mucho faster, we want to eventually keep some essential smoke and OS-specific tests there though.

"Hi, in this project https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode/wiki/Project-Ideas-Improve-File-Classification

let's say i built a machine learning model that very accurately determines the programming language. Now can somebody guide me or give a hint regarding how do i find the 'purpose' of the file  ?  

Here is an approach i was thinking of: 
1) Test files - once the programming language is detected, check if that file imports any one of the known unit testing library for that language, if yes then it's likely that its purpose is for unit testing.

2) Documentation - mostly are markdown/plain english files. Some extra checks can be thought of after the model classifies it as normal plain english/markdown.

3) setup files - ???",no

"@dimitraka regarding your question about deltacode, the list of tasks you mentioned would be apart of that DeltaCode project:
- license_expression support would include adding the license-expression library to DeltaCode and changing the license diff engine to use license expression only. 
- package_url support would include adding the package-url library to DeltaCode and adding some sort of package_url diffing in DeltaCode as well.
- ScanCode virtual codebase support would come after migrating to python3, and is a fairly major change to the structure of DeltaCode
- flagging deltas would be a small feature that can be added as we migrate to python3, and would mainly be a change to the way Deltas are scored if they contain a hard Copyleft or commercial license.

"I have python 3.6 along with python 3.7 , how can i explicitly configure with python 3.6",no
"@majurg thank you so much for reviewing my idea 
So about the details as suggested by you 
1) How your extension checking will work 
The solution for this is maybe silly but strong extension checking will be done by reading the name of the file and sort it according to its extension like if .py file shows the file with Python extension and likewise this will be the first check for the file classification.
2) What exact NLP algorithms/techniques you will be using, 
To be honest, I don't have a lot of work in NLP. I just know a thing what NLP can do and have basic information about it. Presently I have in my mind that to create the Lexical Analyzer for the project which will decide on the basis of the information from the Lexical Tokens. 
3) How ""unnamed"" file detection will work 
I am working for the solution to this problem but till now we can apply only a single check for it and that is by just going through the name of the file if nothing is there the file is unnamed. 
4) How hashing will help determine file extension/type 
We will use hashing only for finding same files in the project repository not other so for file extension. We can go through the first point for that. 
5) How you plan to match to a framework 
For solving this problem maybe we have to create the specific model for it which will check the number of specific files in the project repository and will act likewise. For this task, the study with the files is needed which is going on from my side. I think that during the completion of the project we must initially strive for some famous frameworks like django and flask and then afterward we must go for the rest of the frameworks.

 I am still working on this project and finding ways required for solutions and proceeding every day",no

The way the GSoC works is that if we are accepted as an org, we propose a bunch of project ideas. You can come with you own too. Aspiring students submit project proposals for these ideas or new ideas. We (the mentors and org admins) of our org then review and rank the proposed projects we received.

I am Arzoo, a fifth-year student at the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur pursuing Computer Science & Engineering (Dual-Degree). I am looking for GSoC 2020 and for the same, I have a proposal in my mind.

Proposal: Improvements and enhancements in website
A community website plays an important role for an open-source organization because it spreads the idea of offerings that community provide, their precious contributions, their skills, their members, etc. So, my project will aim to increase the usability and easiness for all the open-source contributors by improving and enhancing the AboutCode website for developers, newcomers as well as for other organizations. The major focus of this project is to enhance the architecture of the website by introducing new pages like projects and further grouping them into completed, active and archived, past GSoC students (their projects, their mentors, status of their projects), FAQs in different languages, mentors, admins, documentation, filters for projects, newcomer invitation form, feedback form, etc.. As well as, redesigning and restructure of the existing website and making it responsive so that it looks good on different devices.

I will use these technologies - python, jekyll, html, javascript, Angular JS.

Looking forward for precious feedback.
I can also give a detailed proposal.

Thanks & Regards,
Arzoo",no
@arzoo14 thanks,no
@AyanSinhaMahapatra how would this be different from your efforts to date? ^,no
"IMHO it does sound a bit like a GSoD project, as the focus of this sounds like user experience and how good the website is/looks (does aboutcode website refer to any other website like the aboutcode.org one?). A lot of other major open source projects also use ReadTheDocs or similar documentation systems and that's more logical IMHO. As you rightly point out, the documentation, getting started sections and everything else is already in shape due to my GSoD project, and in it's current shape easier to maintain and update, with the code, than going for something fancier, frontend wise. Having another better website is surely great, but I'm not sure how much that'll add to what we already have, and how that'll be appropriate to GSoC 2020 (rather than focusing on more urgent code oriented projects like previous year). Even for next year's GSoD I'd suggest we go for documenting more other projects in their respective repositories, or add more sections to the existing ones, through ReadTheDocs or something similar, as the team already planned(?).

Sorry for the late reply(very busy atm). Someone confirm whether I am right about what the NSIS installer should do.
1. It should check whether the appropriate Python version is installed. 
2. If not, then install it. I am not very clear about whether 'our installer' 
     should configure the environmental variables for python.
3. Run the configure script in the background.
4. Maybe set path variable such that, scancode can be launched from

Added this Issue https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/1790,no
"@sbs2001 excellent. So we use mostly data-driven tests for license detection.
Each test consists of a pair of files:
- a file that needs to be tested for a license scan (typically tex, but it can be anything). Say that file is named `gpl-2.0_abc.txt`. The name has no meaning at all.
- a second file named after the first file with a `.yml` extension added such as in `gpl-2.0_abc.txt.yml`. This file contains YAML and mostly a `license_expressions` list as in this
```
license_expressions:
    - gpl-2.0
```

... assuming here we expect that a GPL 2.0 will be detected in that `gpl-2.0_abc.txt` test file

We have many such test file pairs. Thousands of them. 
See for example
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/tests/licensedcode/data/licenses/apache-2.0_and_lgpl-2.1.txt

https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/tests/licensedcode/data/licenses/apache-2.0_and_lgpl-2.1.txt.yml

"the net thing is that you could craft one test pair for each of your 33 files by adding a companion .yml file for each with the expected `license_expressions`. You could then slam these as a dir in tests/license/data/licenses. Say in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/tests/licensedcode/data/licenses/github_key/

`pytest -vvs tests/licensedcode/test_detection_datadriven1.py -k github_keys` to select only these tests",no

@sbs2001 but one thing to consider on your side: adding new license detection rules require the index to be regenerated (it happens automatically when the SCANCODE_DEV_MODE tag file is there in your checkout) ... but this may be a master pain for you since it was taking a long time to generated the license index on you machine :| ,no
Btw @pombredanne I was just taking look at various license.txt and license.yml pairs in our tests/licensedcode/data/licenses. There is one particular file I found interesting it has name 'apache-1.1_and_apache-1.1_and_apache-1.1_and.yml' what does that signify,no

"re: 

>'apache-1.1_and_apache-1.1_and_apache-1.1_and.yml' what does that signify

I has no meaning. As a visual convention we often name test file pairs after the licenses that should be detected.... but that's just a convenience and has no impact at all on the process.
",no
the test files could be called gpl.txt and  gpl.txt.yml and contain an MIT license alright,no

YES, binary mode",no
Which mode i use `r`,no
@Abhishek-Dev09 what I am saying is that a fileset file in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/src/commoncode/fileset.py#L189 should be loaded in `rb` mode only on Python 2 and Linux and should be loaded in plain `r` or with no explicit mode in all other cases,no

```
from commoncode import fileset

patterns = [b'/foo/*', b'!/foobar/*', b'bar/*', b'#comment']
get_matches('foo/baz/', patterns)

This will very likely fail: paths are no longer bytes.
